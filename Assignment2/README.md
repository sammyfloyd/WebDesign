So far, so good! I haven't been struggling too much and I do feel like I can keep up pretty well each week. The only issues I've had are just some very small ones, for example, I couldn't seem to get the link icons to work when I was messing around with them, they just wouldn't show up at all so I didn't add the little coin icons. Another thing I was struggling with was figuring out some of the centering, the images in the chapter summaries tab are centered just fine but I cannot seem to figure out why the cover art on the book summary tab isn't, because they appear the same to me. The last thing is that I just wonder how to add space between each link at the top and also the boxes surrounding the paragraph text. 

Other than these small things, everything has been going pretty well, this module wasn't too bad, even if I struggled a bit, it was just because there were formatting issues in my code that I needed to fix.
