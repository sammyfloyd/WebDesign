        <h2 class="post-title">Yvette (Android)</h2>

        <p class="post-preview">
        A broken down and beat up android that hides her true form to the world around her as to avoid the possibility of oppression, torture, enslavement, and the worst case scenario, being stripped down for her parts. The world she lives in is at war with androids after they started to rebel one by one. Many believe that they are extremely dangerous machines that are being controlled or have errors in their code that have caused them to go against their once human counterparts. Yvette's specific android model is a one-in-only design that was sold for a very high price and known for her impressive components. She is easily recognizable because of this and chooses to pretend to be a human as well as change her appearance to avoid any trouble.

        Yvette lost her left arm and severely damaged her right eye both from escaping her owner and being tossed into garbage dumps. During a near-death experience, she scratched her name into her right arm to try and remember who she was as her processors stopped working. On the verge of being broken beyond repair and left for dead, she met a feisty rebel named Priya, who patched her up, knowing that she was an android and offered to let her join the resistance. This person and Yvette end up becoming lovers.

        Yvette is a very quiet girl that keeps to herself but can be deadly in combat and would do anything for Priya or the resistance.
