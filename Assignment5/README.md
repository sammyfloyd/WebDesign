I am struggling a bit when it comes to my grid.html, I have tried to fix the fact that this page continues to go on vertically instead horizontal after the blog previews by trying to make sure that the divs are fully closed out but I'm not sure that's the issue. I am a bit lost on where to look to fix this in all honesty. I also altered some of my website pages to look moreso how I wanted so some of them don't look exactly like what you instructed us to do earlier, but I still believe all the assignment requirements should be met.
