I like that Flexbox and Grid can help create these more complex website layouts with text boxes and images without having to do so much math. They make it much simpler to align things in a more unique way that will captivate the viewer. For this reason, I think it will make future projects for this class much easier. One of the things I struggled with was the alignment for certain things so it is nice to learn about these tools and be able to use them in the future. So far I prefer Flexbox because from what I know, it seems more like what you would see on a typical blog. Grid appears to be much more image heavy.
